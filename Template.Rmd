```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction
data were taken from here <https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/open-data>[^1]

[^1]: Here is the [link](https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/open-data) to our data.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
glacier <- read.csv('38100089.csv', na.strings = '..', stringsAsFactors = T)
```

The data set contains `r nrow(glacier)` rows and `r nlevels(glacier$GEO)` glaciers. Data were taken from `r min(glacier$REF_DATE)` to `r max(glacier$REF_DATE)` years. The data set includes this glaciers 

 
## Hypothesis

Are there statistically significant changes in glaciers mass in observed period? 
For these purposes we will use **R** (version `r getRversion()`). It is better to choose for it **t-test**

What we going to do:

1. Read file
2. Run t-test for each glacier and collect p_values
3. Support the evidence with
   + a table of results;
   + a graph.
